# Group Project #1 - Meal Planning Website

## Objective
The objective of this project was to create a website that has an interactive front-end application. As a group, we decided to create a meal planning website using Spoonacular as our third-party API (https://spoonacular.com/food-api).

Our users will:
* come to our site and when they select a cuisine option from a dropdown box, they are presented with 8 meal recipes to select from. 
* Then when the user selects are recipe, then they are presented with a recipe card that includes the title, a picture and the directions and a box with all of the needed ingredients. When the user decides which recipe they would like to use, they click a button to save the ingredients and are lead to the new html page that has the shopping list.
* Then the user can remove items from the shopping list as they purchase them or if they do not need to buy them.
